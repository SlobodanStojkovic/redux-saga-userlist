# Redux Saga Userlist

## Redux Saga userlist is a simple web application built using React and Redux Saga to call for data from API. Redux saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

### The redux-saga middleware takes care of executing the function call and resuming the generator with the resolved response. This allows us to easily test the Generator outside the Redux environment. Because call is just a function which returns a plain Object.
